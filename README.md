# Humble Superhero API

## Description
This is a simple API built using NestJS that allows users to add and fetch superheroes sorted by their humility score. The frontend is built with React and TailwindCSS.

## Features
- Add a superhero with name, superpower, and humility score.
- Fetch superheroes sorted by humility score in descending order.
- Simple React frontend to interact with the API.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository  
2. Install dependencies for the backend  (cd humble-superhero-api folder then npm install)
3. Install dependencies for the frontend  (cd humble-superhero-ui folder then npm install)

## If I Had More Time
If I had more time, I would improve the project in the following ways:

1. **Persistent Database:**  
- Instead of using an in-memory array, I would use a database like PostgreSQL or MongoDB to persist superhero data. (I prefer MongoDB)

2. **Users and Authentication:**  
- With the help of a teammate I would like to add user funcionalities with login and register, and implement user authentication with JWT or OAuth to allow users to manage their own superhero lists.  

3. **More API Endpoints:**  
- Add an endpoint to update superhero information.  
- Add an endpoint to delete a superhero.  

4. **Frontend Enhancements:**  
- As UX/UI is not my strong suit, i would collaborate with a teammate to improve the UI with animations and better styling using Tailwind. Maybe add a loading spinner for better UX when fetching data.  

5. **Testing:**  
- Expand **unit tests** and add **integration tests** to ensure all endpoints work correctly.  

6. **Deployment:**  
- Deploy the backend using **Railway**, **Render**, or **Heroku**.  
- Deploy the frontend using **Vercel** or **Netlify**.
